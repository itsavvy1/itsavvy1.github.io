										<h2 class="major">Important</h2>
										<p> Well, so where do we begin? I'm also confused, but hey, don't judge me! Okay, how about a little introduction, could work, right? Cool, I'm Jean. Well, some can say I'm not a lucky kid, but cmon. Who cares anyways. I don't want to get personal but my greatest weakness lies in my Gf. Well, it is normal right? No? Cmon, my granddady told me a boy's story is not complete without a girl, but damn, to hell with those old sayings. I love my family and everything about them. On my free time, I'd preffer to code, Listen or Play guitar to my favorite songs, or Sleep. Well, on the last part there I kinda lied, I like sleeping even when its not on a free period, Ok, now you get it! I like watching animation and horror films. And also, I like playing video games, Im sure you're now wondering how do i have all this likes and loves all at the same time, Yeah, Its what that makes me happy! <em>What about you?</em></p>

										<p>I believe you have never visited such a site before, but dont worry, you're not in the wrong place. First of all, let me ask you a question, have you ever wondered what to do about your issues in technology for instance? But yet, you tried to ask the same question say maybe in a Facebook page/group, and you were banned because they thought you are a scam? asking noobie questions? Yes? Then you are just in the right place</p>

										<h2 class="major">A bother</h2>
										<p>Well, its sad that throught this page, I've just nbeen too personal, but if you like it, im glad. If you don't, i bet i don't either, but I wish some few people could get my point especially on my bothers. I'm not trying to make a make a ask.com site but all of us at ssome point want to ask somebody something. I will personally feel stupid if i asked something that i could easily <a href="https://www.google.com"/>Google</a> and just get a better explanation. Well, im not being biased or something, I have already talked about this, all im trying to say is that whenever you have a problem, someone had had that problem somewhere in this huge world, and probably, it was solved, so google it, its free!</p>
